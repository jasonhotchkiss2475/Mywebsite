    <div id="about">
      <h1>About</h1>
      <div id="one_p">
        <p> I grew up in the world of action sports and as a young motocross racer,
          I always wanted to be the best I could be and consistently looking to edge out
          the competition through either fitness training or equipment upgrades.
          That sort of mindset continued through whatever hobby or career choice I made
          and continues to this very day.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="two_p">
        <p>Art has always been in my blood as well and when I wanted to perform the best I could,
          also had to have the coolest looking gear to show, from custom painted helmets to matching
          designs on the bike, but that's not all the art I was trying to show off! Graphic design was
          an interest of mine since a young age, but as an adult, the hands-on experience led me to
          build a classic Triumph motorcycle and a 1949 Ford hotrod. Metalwork and painting are
          so much fun! </p>
      </div>
      <div id="three_p">
        <p>There's much more to this story though as computer programs such as Adobe
          Illustrator, Photoshop, and now creating cool looking, responsive, functional websites
          have piqued my interest with all the critical thinking and problem solving to produce a
          one-off design. Although the design draws me in the most, having a flawless working
          website is just like having a well-oiled machine that I built!!!
